## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Querys
- Javascript vanilla


### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox for styling layouts and how to create gradients as well, this was for the button styling.

I also learned more about regular expressions when I was validating the email from the user input, I did a little research in [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) ðŸ’¡.

I had so much fun learning new things and putting in practice the knowledge from html, css and js that I got so far! ðŸ˜„


### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about design and styling web pages because that's not my best. I prefer working with back end but I know that front end is also important and since I like it I want to improve my skills.

I've heard that front end mentor is the perfect place to do that so here I am! I hope I can make it through more challenges.


### Useful resources

- [How to validate email with javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - This helped me to comprehend more about regular expresions using javascript I hope it can be of help for others.
